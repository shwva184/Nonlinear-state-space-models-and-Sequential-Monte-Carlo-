Using of a non-linear state space model for analyzing the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing covid-19. We will use an epidemiological model referred to
as a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. It is a stochastic adaptation of the model used by the The Public Health Agency of Sweden for predicting the spread of
covid-19 in the Stockholm region early in the pandemic, see Estimates of the peak-day and the number of infected individuals during the covid-19 outbreak in the Stockholm region,
Sweden February â€“ April 2020.
